# College-Attendance-System
Changed the whole ui and edited the code.
I have taken this project from github which was originally made by a team :- 
1. Umang Shukla
2. Pranay Sharma
3. Krishnan Iyer 

This project was based on java using mysql but with oracle connectivity. So i changed the code of project based on mysql using xampp which in turn i had to edit the whole code and fix most of the errors came while editing the code which was really not that hard who had done 6 weeks training of java from a good institute but some error hard to fix. But i almost did it. Yeah i know it is still not a fully error free project. The most unfortunate thing was that if a team of three people was created just to give whole work to a single person then what was the purpose of creating a team and two of them know java (one being me) then why i had to do all work of editing the whole project? Atlast i don't care about second person who knows java(may be not)...........
